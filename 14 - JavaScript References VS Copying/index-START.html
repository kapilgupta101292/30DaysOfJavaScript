			// You might think we can just do something like this:

			// however what happens when we update that array?

			// now here is the problem!

			// oh no - we have edited the original array too!

			// Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

			// So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

			// one way

			// or create a new array and concat the old one in

			// or use the new ES6 Spread

			// now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

			// The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

			// with Objects
			const person = {
				name: 'Wes Bos',
				age: 80,
			};

			// and think we make a copy:
			const captain = person;
			captain.number = 99;

			const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });

			// how do we take a copy instead?

			// console.log(cap3);

			console.log(dev, wes);
			dev.social.twitter = '@coolman';
			console.log(dev, wes);
			// We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

			// Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
